<h1 align="center">Welcome to Date Sidekick 👋</h1>
<p>
</p>

> This is the React frontend for Date Sidekick. Deciding what where to go on a date is hard. I have spent countless hours debating what place to eat at or what activity to do. Date Sidekick fixes this issues. There are two main functions of Date Sidekick. 

1. Random Mode: This is my personal favorite, enter your zipcode and select food or food and activity and date sidekick will give you a date in your area. 

2. If you want more control you can always create your own date from a selection of items in your area. Once you decide on a date you can save it to your profile for later use. 

###### Date Sidekick uses Yelp-Fusion API to get all the information. 

>Frontend is built with React and styled with bootstrap. https://github.com/turpp/dateSidekick

## Usage

>To make this work with the Date Sidekick API https://github.com/turpp/date_sidekick_api we need to start this application in localhost:3001. If you use a different port make sure to adjust the cors.rb file in the backend.
```javascript
 npm start
```
> Make sure your server is running in localhost:3000 and your front end is hosted on localhost:3001 due to cors.
